# React Library Template
This template provides the boilerplate for creating a new React component library using MUI for atomic elements. A custom starter MUI theme (for ThemeProvider) is included, and the project is pre-configured to support theme-switching directly in the Storybook UI. 

Additional preconfigurations include: Typescript, ESlint, and Jest.
